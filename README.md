K-Means clustering analysis of global life expectancy data to identify health patterns and group similar countries(2024).

# Life Expectancy Clustering Analysis (2024)

This project applies K-Means clustering to group countries based on life expectancy-related features. It uses data preprocessing techniques and the Elbow Method to determine the optimal number of clusters. The goal is to explore global health patterns and similarities between countries.

## 🧪 Project Steps
1. Import Libraries and Load Data
2. Data Preprocessing for Clustering
3. Determine Optimal Number of Clusters (Elbow Method)
4. Fit K-Means with Optimal Clusters
5. Create and Analyze a Confusion Matrix

## 📊 Tools & Technologies
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Google Colab
- K-Means Clustering

## 📁 Dataset
The dataset includes life expectancy, health indicators, economic features, and demographic data across multiple countries.

## 🔍 Key Findings
- Countries with similar health profiles cluster together
- Clear distinctions emerge based on GDP, mortality rate, and immunization coverage
- Clustering provides insights into public health priorities by region
